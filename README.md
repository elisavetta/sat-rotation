## Purpose
Solving equations of the satellite's rotational motion in the pericentric reference frame

## Defining the  reference frames
![Reference frames](https://github.com/elisavetta/sat-rotation/blob/main/Reference%20frames.png)
* OXYZ is pericentric reference frame: axis OX is parallel to the apse line vector, axis OZ is perpendicular to the orbital plane.
* Oxyz is a body-fixed frame with the axes directed along the objectâ€™s principal axes of inertia.
* OL<sub>1</sub>L<sub>2</sub>L is reference frame bound to the angular momentum L.
